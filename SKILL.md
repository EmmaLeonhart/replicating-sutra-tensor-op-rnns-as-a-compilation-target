# Replicate: Sutra: Tensor-Op RNNs as a Compilation Target for Vector Symbolic Architectures

arXiv:2605.20919 - Emma Leonhart - 2026-05-20T09:04:36Z
PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.20919v1 - HTML: https://arxiv.org/html/2605.20919v1

## Prerequisite

If `replication_target/source/` is empty, run `python download_paper.py`
first. It fetches the arXiv **LaTeX/e-print source** (https://arxiv.org/src/2605.20919v1), extracts it to
`replication_target/source/`, and saves the PDF as a fallback. Read the `.tex`
in `source/` directly — it is far more token-efficient than the rendered HTML
(no base64 figure blobs) and is where the authors' reproduction recipe usually
lives. Fall back to the PDF only for PDF-only submissions.

## Plan

The efficient path: get the source, **find the authors' reproduction recipe
FIRST**, run it, then verify its output against the paper and fill only the
gaps. Reimplementing from scratch is the fallback, not the default.

1. **Acquire the LaTeX source.** `python download_paper.py` → extracts the
   e-print source to `replication_target/source/` (committed) and saves the PDF
   (gitignored). Read the `.tex` directly.

2. **Go live early.** Create a PUBLIC GitHub repo and push
   (`gh repo create --public --source=. --push`) so every later commit pushes
   and Pages/CI build as you go — don't leave it local-only.

3. **Find the reproduction recipe in the source — before reading the whole
   paper.** Authors often ship one near the end of the paper: a `SKILL.md` /
   `AGENTS.md`, a `reproduce.*` / `replicate.*` / `run.sh` script, a `Makefile`
   target, a Dockerfile, or a **replication zip**. `download_paper.py` flags
   candidates; also grep the `.tex` for "reproduc"/"replicat"/"skill"/
   "github.com". Copy a recipe file to `replication_skill.md`; extract a
   replication zip into `replication/`; add the authors' code repo as a **git
   submodule** under `replication_target/`. Record findings in
   `notes/sources.md`.

4. **Run the recipe first** (if any): set up just enough to execute it, capture
   output to `results/`, and assess how much of the paper's headline claims it
   reproduces. With a working recipe the rest is verification, not from-scratch
   reimplementation.

5. **Check ALL references** — every run, recipe or not. Confirm the key cited
   results/datasets/baselines the paper relies on say what it claims.

6. **Record `notes/claims.md`** — scoped to what the recipe didn't cover:
   headline claim(s); datasets (version/hash, location); models/methods in
   re-implementable detail; metrics and exact reported numbers; compute envelope
   (decides if CI can auto-run this).

7. **Reimplement only the gaps** under `src/`; pin `requirements.txt` /
   `environment.yml`. Scope to the headline claim, not every ablation.

8. **Run the replication.** `scripts/run.py` so CI can invoke it; metrics →
   `results/`.

9. **Write the findings.** `FINDINGS.md`: reproduced vs. reported (table);
   what the recipe covered vs. what you filled; gaps and divergences.

10. **Publish.** GitHub Pages deploys the findings + a transportable PDF report
    (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`); a ZIP replication package is built
    (`.github/workflows/package.yml`). The repo must be public with Pages set to
    Source: GitHub Actions.

## Budget guardrails

- If the paper's reported compute is more than ~4 GPU-hours on a single
  consumer GPU, mark this replication **not CI-runnable** in `paper.json` and
  document the reduced-scale variant instead.
- Prefer deterministic seeds and logged hashes so reruns are comparable.

## Definition of done

- `FINDINGS.md` exists and reports at least one headline number from the
  paper, with the reproduced value next to it.
- `scripts/run.py` runs end-to-end from a clean clone (or documents the data
  step that can't be automated).
- The repo is public and pushed; the GitHub Pages site and the ZIP package
  build green in Actions.
- This file still reflects how you actually did it — if you deviated, edit
  the plan above.
