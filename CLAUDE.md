# replicating-sutra-tensor-op-rnns-as-a-compilation-target

## Project Description

This is a **paper replication** project (scaffolded by `cleanvibe replicate`).
The goal is to reproduce the headline results of:

> **Sutra: Tensor-Op RNNs as a Compilation Target for Vector Symbolic Architectures**
> arXiv:2605.20919 - Emma Leonhart - 2026-05-20T09:04:36Z
> PDF: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2605.20919v1 - HTML: https://arxiv.org/html/2605.20919v1

It produces three compounding artifacts (see `docs/replication_framing.md`
in the cleanvibe repo for the full framing): the runnable replication, a
legibility layer (the published findings report), and `SKILL.md` — the
reusable, agent-executable replication methodology.

## Architecture and Conventions

- **The efficient path is recipe-first.** Authors very often ship a
  reproduction recipe right in the paper's e-print source (usually near the
  end). Find and run it FIRST, then verify its output against the paper and
  fill only the gaps. A from-scratch reimplementation is the fallback, not the
  default — it is what burned a huge amount of tokens before this convention.
- **`replication_target/`** holds the paper and everything pulled *about* it:
  - `replication_target/source/` — the extracted arXiv **LaTeX/e-print
    source** (committed; run `python download_paper.py`). **Primary** source:
    the `.tex` reads far more token-efficiently than the rendered HTML (no
    base64 figure blobs) and is where the reproduction recipe usually lives.
  - `replication_target/arxiv-source.tar.gz` — the raw source archive
    (gitignored; the extracted `source/` is what's committed).
  - `replication_target/paper.pdf` — the PDF, as a fallback / complete record
    (gitignored, same downloader). The paper does NOT go in `data_lake/`.
  - the authors' code, if any, cloned as a **git submodule** in here
    (`git submodule add <repo> replication_target/<name>`).
- **`replication_skill.md`** (repo root) — if the source/paper ships a
  reproduction recipe, copy it here and run it first. **`replication/`** — if a
  replication zip is shipped/linked, extract it here (the zip is gitignored,
  its contents committed).
- **`data_lake/`** — other downloaded/supplied material (datasets, notes,
  exports). Same cleanvibe convention as every project. The paper is NOT here.
- **`src/`** — your reimplementation (only the gaps the recipe didn't cover).
  **`scripts/run.py`** — the entry point CI invokes. **`results/`** — metrics
  JSON (gitignored). **`FINDINGS.md`** — the report (reproduced vs. reported,
  what the recipe covered vs. what you filled, gaps, divergences).
- **Go live early.** Create a PUBLIC GitHub repo and push near the start so
  every commit pushes and CI/Pages build as you go — don't leave it local-only.
- **Deliverables are built by GitHub Actions, not committed.**
  `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes the GitHub Pages site + PDF report;
  `.github/workflows/package.yml` builds the downloadable ZIP replication
  package. You must make the repo public and enable Pages (Settings -> Pages
  -> Source: GitHub Actions) — the workflows carry TODO markers for this.

## Workflow Rules

- **Commit early and often.** Every meaningful change gets a descriptive commit.
- **Plan into `queue.md` first, then execute.** The replication plan already
  lives in `queue.md` (derived from `SKILL.md`). Work it top to bottom.
- **Finishing a queue item = delete from `queue.md` + append dated entry to
  `devlog.md`**, in the same commit as the work, then push. Never tick
  boxes in place. `devlog.md` is also where you record the replication's
  releases/milestones (source acquired, recipe found/run, environment pinned,
  first reproduced number, FINDINGS published, Pages live).
- **Keep `SKILL.md` truthful.** It is the compounding artifact. If you
  deviated from its plan, edit the plan to match what you actually did.
- **Keep this file and `README.md` current** as the replication takes shape.

## Writing

- Do not use "honest", "honesty", or "honestly" — and do not swap in "frank", "frankly", "candid", "candidly", or "transparently", which are the same self-congratulatory move in a different coat. When something failed, name the failure: "it didn't work", "I got that wrong", "this failed" — flat, no qualifier. Tagging a report "honest" implies the rest aren't, and couching a failure as honesty asks for credit for the admission, which is worse than the failure itself. Use a precise positive word ("accurate", "plainly", "truly") only when that is genuinely the meaning — never as a halo on a bad outcome.
